# Peer Review

## Overview

It doesn't take long to learn that most coding problems have already been [solved by others](http://www.stackoverflow.com); but reading other people's code and applying it to your own problems takes practice. You will begin to develop this skill by reading your classmates' code, evaluating their approach to problems, providing suggestions, and pointing out when you learned something new. This is an essential skill that will help you improve your own programming technique by learning from how others code, and by getting detailed feedback from your peers.  

After each homework, each of you will be randomly assigned to evaluate a homework from a peer and given until the *following class meeting* to provide peer review. For this, you are required to grade and provide feedback on both the `.html` output and `.Rmd` syntax files for peer homework assignments. Both the reviewer and the reviewee will be anonymized to reduce potential biases.

## Evaluation of Peer Review
For each homework assignment, you will receive either 0 or 1 point for your peer review, with 20% of your overall course grade coming from thsi activity. Additionally, *failure to complete peer reviews may result in points removed from homeworks.*

**Good** peer reviews:

* **Give constructive, polite, and insightful comments**
* Are specific and concise
* Use the grading rubric and guidelines below
* Point out where you learned from their code (if you did)

**Poor** peer reviews:

* **Are impolite or unprofessional**
* Generic or non-specific; could be applied to anyone's homework
* Fail to: offer praise, show what you learned, or provide useful suggestions

## Grading Rubric
Homeworks will be evaluated by peers on a 0 to 3 scale. The overall scores are 
shown below with example situations in bullets below each.

0: Didn't turn anything in

1: Turned in but low effort, ignoring many directions

  * No attempt made on any one problem.
  * Attempts made on all problems but nothing worked
  * `.html` file did not knit / was not provided
  * `.Rmd` file not provided
  
2: Decent effort, followed directions with some minor issues

  * Some code fails to work, but a reasonable attempt was made.
  * `.html` file knitted but is poorly formatted
  * `.Rmd` syntax is disorganized or hard to follow
  
3: Nailed it

  * All problems answered with no errors or omissions
  * Code and output are clearly organized
  * Clever or elegant possibly solutions used

## Some Review Suggestions
Here are some guidelines for reviewing scientific computing code [from Andrea Zonca](https://zonca.github.io/2014/08/code-review-for-scientific-computing.html), which you should consider to guide your feedback:

> Coding style should not be the main focus of the review, the most important feedback for the author are high-level comments on software organization. The reviewer should focus on what makes the software more usable and more maintenable.
>
> A few examples:
>
>    * can some parts of the code be simplified?
>    * is there any functionality that could be replaced by an existing library?
>    * is it clear what each part of the software is doing?
>    * is there a more straightforward way of splitting the code into files?
>    * is documentation enough?
>    * are there some function arguments or function names that could be easily misinterpreted by a user?
>
> The purpose is to improve the code, but also to help the code author to improve her coding skills.

## When to Contact the Instructor
A number of situations may warrant contacting the instructor:

1. If you believe you have received an unfair peer review, you can **resubmit** your 
homework for evaluation by the instructor. The assignment will be regraded, which may
result in a higher, same, or lower grade.
2. If you wish for more feedback on a particular part of the homework, you can ask
the instructor for additional explanation *without resubmitting*.
3. If you receive no feedback, the instructor will provide *gentle* peer review on request.
